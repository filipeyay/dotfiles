# My Dotfiles

My dotfiles for Visual Studio Code, Windows Terminal, Neovim and Tmux.

I use WSL2 btw.

**WARNING**: I cannot guarantee that copying the settings will work as expected. Please make a backup of your personal settings before using the ones in this repository.

**NOTE**: Most of things you'll need to install for Neovim is on [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/).

## Fonts

I use [iA Writer](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/iA-Writer.zip) , a heavy modification of [IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/IBMPlexMono.zip) font.
